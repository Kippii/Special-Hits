# Special-Hits
This is a special plugin that allows server owners to increase the amount of damage that occurs when there is a special hit. Currently, the only special hits we have are headshots and backstabs. Whenever one of these is done, you can set an amount of extra damage (use negatives if you want them to loose damage.) All you have to do is manipulate the config.yml. Here is the format:
```
HeadshotExtraDamage: 20
BackstabExtraDamage: 20
```
Just set the numbers and enjoy the extra damage that these cool special shots give away.
